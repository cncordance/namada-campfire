# Run a Node on Campfire

**Ready to join [Campfire](https://testnet.luminara.icu), our community-run Namada testnet?** üèïÔ∏è  

**Here's how to run a node:**  

*Note: you can view the general docs for Namada [here](https://docs.namada.net).*  

If you've previously run a node on the `shielded-expedition`, the process for running on Campfire is very similar -- with a couple minor differences for changing the configs-server location and manually downloading the wasm files.

### 1. Install Namada
1. Check the Campfire [landing page](https://testnet.luminara.icu) to see which version of Namada you will need.
2. Install [Namada](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases) according to the [instructions](https://docs.namada.net/introduction/install) in the docs. You can either download the pre-built binaries from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases) page, or clone the repo and build from source. There are also Docker images available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/spork666/namada) and [here](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pkgs/container/namada).
3. Verify your installation with `docker run -P -i -t $DOCKER_IMAGE -V`.

### 2. Initialize your node (`join-network`)
1. Check the Campfire [landing page](https://testnet.luminara.icu); you will need the current chain-id.
2. First, set the following env variable in your terminal. This will instruct the `join-network` command to look on the Campfire server when downloading the genesis files: 
```bash copy
export NAMADA_NETWORK_CONFIGS_SERVER="https://testnet.luminara.icu/configs"
```
3. Next, fetch the genesis files:  
*Note: the flag `--dont-prefetch-wasm` is important*
```bash copy
namadac utils join-network --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --dont-prefetch-wasm
```

### 3. Download the chain WASM files
1. Download and extract the wasm files from the link on the [landing page](https://testnet.luminara.icu):
```bash copy
wget https://testnet.luminara.icu/wasm.tar.gz
tar -xf wasm.tar.gz
```
2. Place the wasm files in your node's chain data directory:
```bash copy
cd wasm
cp ./* ~/.local/share/namada/$CHAIN_ID/wasm
```

### 3. Add `persistent_peers`
Find the persistent peer address on the [landing page](https://testnet.luminara.icu) and add it to your node's config file:  
*Note: below is an example value; yours will be slightly different*
```bash copy
# in file ~/.local/share/namada/$CHAIN_ID/config.toml
persistent_peers = "tcp://af427e348cd45dd7308be4ea58f1492098e057b8@143.198.36.225:26656"
```

### 4. Start the node
The basic command to start your node is:
```bash copy
namada node ledger run
```
You can check the section in the docs on [Running a full node](https://docs.namada.net/operators/ledger) for further info, including logging options and running your node pesistently in the background using `systemd`.

### 5. (Optional) Use a snapshot for faster syncing
Rather than syncing your node from the first block, you can use a snapshot taken from a recent block height. The [landing page](https://testnet.luminara.icu) will have a download link to a recent snapshot in `tar.lz4` format.  

To apply the snapshot:
1. Stop your node
2. Run `sudo apt install lz4` if lz4 is not already installed on your system
3. Download the `tar.lz4` snapshot file from the testnet landing page
4. Extract the contents to a temp directory of your choice:
```bash copy
lz4 -c -d {filename}.tar.lz4  | tar -x -C {temp-directory}
```
5. If your node is a validator, back up your `priv_validator_state.json` file at this point. (This step is not necessary if you are only running a full node.)
6. Copy the extracted `db` directory to `{namada-dir}/$CHAIN_ID/` (overwrite the existing `db` directory) and copy the `cometbft/data` directory to `{namada-dir}/$CHAIN_ID/cometbft/` (overwrite the existing `data` directory).
7. If you backed up your `priv_validator_state.json` file in step 5, move it back to its original location at `{namada-dir}/$CHAIN_ID/cometbft/data/priv_vallidator_state.json`.
8. Restart your node.
9. You can safely delete the downloaded `tar.lz4` file and the extracted files from step 4.

### 6. (Optional) Become a validator
**Note:** Detailed instructions can be found in the [Post Genesis Validators](https://docs.namada.net/operators/validators/validator-setup#post-genesis-validators) section of the Namada Docs.  

1. Before initializing your validator, you must have a full node that is fully synced to the head of the chain.
2. Get some tokens from the [testnet faucet](https://faucet.luminara.icu) (you will need tokens both to cover transaction gas costs and to stake to your validator).
3. Create your validator with an on-chain transaction using the below command (the `email` parameter is required; however, for testnet you can simply provide a made-up email address).
```bash copy
namadac init-validator \
  --commission-rate 0.05 \
  --max-commission-rate-change 0.01 \
  --email $EMAIL \
  --alias $VALIDATOR_ALIAS
```
4. Optionally, you can also provide other info to identify your validator including a name, logo, website, etc. (this can be done during `init-validator` or later on with the [`change-metadata`](https://docs.namada.net/operators/validators/validator-actions#metadata-changes) command).
5. Restart your node (you will be unable to sign blocks until after you do so).
6. Bond some tokens to your validator. It will take two epochs (equal to the `pipeline_len`) after bonding before your validator becomes active.
```bash copy
namadac bond \
  --validator $VALIDATOR_ALIAS \
  --amount $AMOUNT
```
