## Gitbook Documentation

This folder holds the public gitbook docs for users who wish to run a node on Campfire. The gitbook will sync from this directory, 
so you can make changes to the public docs by editing (or making a pull request to edit) these files.

It's publicly hosted at https://luminara-campfire.gitbook.io/campfire
